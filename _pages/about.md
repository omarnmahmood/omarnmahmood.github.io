I am a PhD student at the NYU Center for Data Science, advised by Kyunghyun Cho and Richard Bonneau.
I am interested in the application of machine learning to problems in computational chemistry and biology,
with a particular focus on graph neural networks.

Prior to joining NYU, I completed a Masters degree at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of
José Miguel Hernández-Lobato.
